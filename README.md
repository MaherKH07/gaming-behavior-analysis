# Decode Gaming Behavior
This project is part of the internship opportunity provided by Mentornees.

Using MySQL, I analyzed a dataset containing player details and game level information to derive valuable insights. The dataset includes player IDs, player names, game levels, difficulty levels, kill counts, headshots counts, and more.

## Objective:
The objective of this project was to analyze gaming data to understand player behavior, performance metrics, and game dynamics. By leveraging SQL queries, I extracted meaningful information from the dataset to inform decision-making processes and optimize game design strategies.

## Key Features:

Analyzed player performance metrics such as kill counts, headshots counts, and scores.
Explored game level details including difficulty levels, stages crossed, and kill counts.
Identified trends, patterns, and correlations within the gaming data.
Conducted data segmentation and aggregation to generate actionable insights.

The gaming data analysis project showcases my proficiency in SQL and data analysis techniques, highlighting my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets. It serves as a testament to my skills in data-driven decision-making and my passion for exploring new insights in the gaming industry.
